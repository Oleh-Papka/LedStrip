# Arduino LedStrip v0.2.1

## Simple LED strip controls (remote and from PC)

Inspiration for the project by [AlexGyver](https://github.com/AlexGyver/ColorMusic), everything else was found in Google).  
This basically is simple "menu" with effects for addressable LED strip ws2812b. Controlled via remote or PC (GUI app). 

## About

### Build with:
- Addres LED strip ws2812b
- Arduino Nano
- vs1838b IR receiver
